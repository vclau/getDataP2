Process

1) Read files First all Test & Train files are read and left into independent data frames Another set of data frames are made for features & activity

Variables:
subjectTest - Contains  subject_test.txt
xTest - Contains X_test.txt
yTest - Contains y_test.txt
subjectTrain - Contains subject_train.txt
xTrain contains X_train.txt
yTrain contains y_train.txt
features contains features.txt
activityLabel contains activity_labels.txt

2)Create Unified dataset Train & Features xTrain & xTest files are rowbinded into a new data frame Features text is then is added as column name and row binded with Train and Test files.

newdb contains de xTrain data
newdb2 contains de xTest data
Names from features file are inserted into the newdb & newdb2 variables and rowbinded
Variable newdb2 is removed


3) Add Subjects & activity Subjects and activity are added into a new data frame that is column binded to the previous one.

subjectData contains subjectTrain
Name "Subject is added to both subjectData & subjectTest
subjectData contains de rowbined data from subjectData & subjectTest
activityData now contains yTrain
NAme "Activity" is added to both activityData & yTest
activityData contains de rowbinded activityData & yTest
newdb3 is an empty data frame with 10299 rows & 2 columns, which are renamed to Subject & Activity

4)Rename Activity Activity numbers are then replaced by descriptions.
A new column filled with  "Unset" is added to activityData
activity labels are matched to the names


5) Subset & Mean A new data frame with a subset of all data including a Mean or Standard deviation is created. We are considering mean every variable that has mean in it, such as: mean() , FreqMean, or GravityMean A new tidy data set is created with just the mean & std columns along with activity & subject

newdb3 gets added subjectData and activityData a new unified Dataset for the analysis is created:
newdb now includes newdb3
subsetMeans gets all the columns that include "mean" on the title 
subsetStd gets all the columns that include "std" 
A new dataset: tidyD is column binded with both sets. 
tidyD is column binded to subject and activity as well as the activity label added

7) Summarized Dataset We melt the data into a new data set, by subject & activity & then cast it by variable using the function mean

meltD gets the melted information of tidyD by subject and activity
tidyD2 contains de cast agreggated information of all variables mean by subject & activity


The new file now provides the mean by subject & activity for each value

8)Save new Dataset The new tidy dataset is exported into a tab delimeted txt file
tidyD2 is printed in  "tidyData.txt"
